* Build document templates in HTML, CSS and JS.
* Connect (basically) any data source for document preview.
* Print the populated templates as decent PDFs, true to view, directly from the browser.
* Generate Swiss QR-Bills as part of an invoice or standalone, or just return the matrix as a svg file.

## Installation

For building entire prp document templates:
```zsh
pnpm add @prpsake/template-viewer
```

Swiss QR-Bills only:
```zsh
